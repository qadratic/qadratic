I am a full stack developer currently pursuing a BTech degree in computer science from Chitkara University, India. I usually make large scale javascript applications from scratch.

I love building things. While my profession is building web services, I also have keen interest in hardware and native technologies. I have worked with C, C++ and Java programming languages in the past. I prefer JavaScript for building big and complex projects because of ever evolving programming patterns and refactoring techniques plus increasing number of open source frameworks built with it.

While hard engineering problems are often fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with business justification.
